## ðŸ”¥ Why Need PixArt-LCM
Following [LCM LoRA](https://huggingface.co/blog/lcm_lora), we illustrative of the generation speed we achieve on various computers. Let us stress again how liberating it is to explore image generation so easily with PixArt-LCM.

| Hardware                    | PixArt-LCM (4 steps) | SDXL LoRA LCM (4 steps) | PixArt standard (14 steps) | SDXL standard (25 steps) |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| T4 (Google Colab Free Tier) | 3.3s                 | 8.4s                    | 16.0s                      | 26.5s                     |
| A100 (80 GB)                | 0.51s                | 1.2s                    | 2.2s                       | 3.8s                      |
| V100 (32 GB)                | 0.8s                 | 1.2s                    | 5.5s                       | 7.7s                      |

These tests were run with a batch size of 1 in all cases.

For cards with a lot of capacity, such as A100, performance increases significantly when generating multiple images at once, which is usually the case for production workloads.

## Training the `PixArt + LCM` on your machine

```bash
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=2 --master_port=12345 train_scripts/train_pixart_lcm.py configs/pixart_config/PixArt_xl2_img1024_lcm.py --work-dir output/train_pixart-lcm
```

## Testing the `PixArt + LCM` on your machine

```bash
DEMO_PORT=12345 python scripts/app_lcm.py

Then have a look at a simple example using the http://your-server-ip:12345
```

## Integration in diffusers
### Using in ðŸ§¨ diffusers

Make sure you have the updated versions of the following libraries:

```bash
pip install -U transformers accelerate diffusers
```

And then:

```python
import torch
from diffusers import PixArtAlphaPipeline, AutoencoderKL

pipe = PixArtAlphaPipeline.from_pretrained("PixArt-alpha/PixArt-LCM-XL-2-1024-MS", torch_dtype=torch.float16, use_safetensors=True)

# Enable memory optimizations.
pipe.enable_model_cpu_offload()

prompt = "A small cactus with a happy face in the Sahara desert."
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]
```

This integration allows running the pipeline with a batch size of 4 under 11 GBs of GPU VRAM.
